		<p>	Our Fidget products are meant to help people who have ADHD and people that fidget too often. This serene instrument provides a smooth yet fast motion that you can control with your fingers. The idea of Fidget toys sprouted from our founders trying to help cope with their attention deficit/ hyperactivity disorder. After ordering some similar concepts online they found that the products were overpriced, unreliable and didn't work too well. The Fidget toy founders decided to take action and start their own company to help others in similar situations. Our company makes the original spinners and we are American made and our products are designed and created in New York.</p>

		<p> Our vision is to provide value to those who fidget. Our original consumer market were children who liked to fidget and people with ADHD but over the course of the past couple months we have found a large interest in other consumer groups. Some of these include school kids, adults under stress and every day carry fans. You can fidget anywhere! Whether it be in school, at work, in traffic or just in your house!</p>
